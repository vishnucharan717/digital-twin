• Built Agentic Alert Analysis system using AWS Bedrock LLMs, integrating PagerDuty, Prometheus, and AWS CloudWatch metrics, significantly reducing AI pipeline latency from 3 minutes to 50 seconds through async execution and LLM warm caching.
• Designed and integrated PostgreSQL (Amazon RDS) and Neo4J GraphDB as knowledge bases, optimizing query pipelines and graph traversal to enable real-time alerting, achieving incident inference in under 200ms and 40% faster data retrieval.
• Implemented dynamic AI model switching, reducing cloud costs by 34.6% per quarter while maintaining performance SLAs.
• Built scalable evaluation pipelines using RAGAS and G-Eval to benchmark AI model accuracy, response consistency and reliability.
• Fine-tuned 13 open-source LLMs using PyTorch and HuggingFace, optimizing inference latency with vLLM and TensorRT-LLM to achieve 60% faster processing, enabling real-time analysis of 10,000+ incidents - improving overall system throughput in PROD.
• Designed retraining pipelines for LLMs with incremental learning on fresh alerts, improving model accuracy - 15% per quarter.
• Built RAG pipelines with LlamaIndex and Pinecone, deployed the Agentic system as Flask microservice on Amazon EKS.
• Earned recognition from the CTO and Global VP of P&T for demonstrating high-impact technical leadership in AI automation.
